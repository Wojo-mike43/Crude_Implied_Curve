# Crude_Implied_Curve

This project calculates an implied forward rate curve using Crude Oil futures for the next two years. It leverages `yfinance`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib` to fetch data, perform calculations, and visualize the forward rate curve based on the price and expiration of several futures contracts.

## How It Works:

- **Contract Tickers:**  
  Tickers are pre-loaded into the code via a Python list.

- **Contract Data:**  
  Using `yfinance`, information about each contract is fetched. Specifically, each contractâ€™s last closing price and expiration date are saved to a dictionary.

- **Forward Rate Calculation:**  
  The dictionary is converted to a pandas DataFrame, with each ticker serving as the index. The dates between the current day and the day of expiration are calculated. The implied forward rate curve is constructed using the contracts' last closing prices and their time-to-maturity.

- **Plotting:**  
  `matplotlib` is used to plot the rate curve.
